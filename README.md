# Neural_Style_Transfer
Using pre-trained CNN model
AIM:- Blending the content image with style image using Optimization technique such that output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.
At its core, neural style transfer is an optimization technique to take two images- a content and a style and blend them together. Original ‘content’ of the target image should remain unchanged
